All the extraction and basic data preprocessing is done in the .py file.

I used Requests module to extract the data

At the moment there was a problem to load the csv data to the mysql workbench that is why query could not run but i have writen the query below which will execute to give the output of top 25 gainers of the day sorted in the order of their gains.


SELECT * 
FROM BHAV_TABLE
ORDER BY gains DESC
LIMIT 25
